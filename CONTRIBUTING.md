Contributions are highly appreciated!

If you have any questions, feature requests or suspected bugs please do not hesitate to 
open a new issue.

If you want to actively contribute code, please follow this advice:
I don't want you to waste your time on changes that I might decline, so please open a new 
issue before implementing any new feature and sending a pull request. I'm happy to 
discuss your idea and give advice on how to best implement it.

If your idea is accepted, simply send the PR against the development branch. 
Contributions should adhere to the coding standards used. All changes and additions 
should be covered by unit tests. We do use spaces here :)
